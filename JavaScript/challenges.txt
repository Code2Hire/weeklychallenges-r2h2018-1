I am attaching the links to the CodePen that contain the problems for this week.
****Copy and paste the questions in your own code pen and work there.***** In submitting
the assignment, simply paste the links to your solutions in a text file and push
that up to GitHub. This will make it easier to only work with JS
without having to worry about any HTML or CSS.
