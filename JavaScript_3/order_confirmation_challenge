order 1: 
    5 pairs of socks. These socks will hug your feet in a way that will make you feel like your grandmother knitted them herself. $5.00 each.
    3 shirts. Helping people feel cool in India’s intense heat made the fabric famous – so imagine how good our Madras Shirt will feel where you live. But we weren’t content to simply recreate the fabric. Although ours is woven in India like the original, we’ve improved it – with single-ply yarns that are ring­spun for strength and improved comfort. $25 each
